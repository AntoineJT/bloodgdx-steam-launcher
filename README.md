# BloodGDX Steam Launcher

Just a simple C program to run bloodgdx when 
launching the game through Steam.

## Preamble

This thing exists because trusting premade
closed source similar launchers is stupid
since I can do this within a minute.

That's why I will not provide prebuilt
versions: just build it yourself, you'll
be sure about the code you're running.

## How to use? (and build)

Just run `build.bat` (it will build the exe file). \
Then, download BuildGDX jar, and put it in your Steam
Blood directory. It must be named `BuildGDX.jar`. \
Rename the original `dosbox.exe` file to whatever 
you want, for example, `dosbox.exe.orig`. \
Copy the compiled `dosbox.exe` to your Blood Steam folder.

You can now run the game using the Steam Play button.

**PS:** Since this is a BloodGDX launcher, you'll
obviously need `java.exe` to be in the PATH of your
system.
